data propcessed

- Create a new raw directory and place the node.json file inside it.

- Put the following files into the processed folder: train_idx.pt, test_idx.pt, val_idx.pt, label.pt, edge_index.pt, edge_type.pt, num_properties_tensor.pt, cat_properties_tensor.pt, tweets_tensor.pt, and des_tensor.pt. These files are generated by the scripts from this repository https://github.com/LuoUndergradXJTU/TwiBot-22/tree/master/src/BotRGCN.

- Run preprocess_twibot20.py/preprocess_twibot22.py to generate the graph_data and final_data directories. Then, modify the corresponding paths in dataset.py and main.py accordingly.

## Train & Test

python main.py --dataset_name "Twibot-20" --batch_size 64 --hidden_dim 128 --weight_decay 1e-2 --structural_learning_rate 1e-4 --temporal_learning_rate 1e-5  --early_stop --patience 20

### Dataset Preparation
The original datasets are available at [Twibot-20](https://github.com/BunsenFeng/TwiBot-20) and [Twibot-22](https://github.com/LuoUndergradXJTU/TwiBot-22).
